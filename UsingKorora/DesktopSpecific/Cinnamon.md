Cinnamon is built on top of core GNOME technologies like GTK and Clutter yet provides a more traditional desktop while still including modern advanced features. More akin to KDE and unlike GNOME, it is designed to be very flexible and configurable. The guides in this section will show you how get the best out of Cinnamon.

Cinnamon uses LightDM as its Display Manger. To configure and customise LightDM see the [LightDM](https://kororaproject.org/support/documentation/lightdm) guide.
