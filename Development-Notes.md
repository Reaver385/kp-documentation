These are notes on the development of this section and will be removed when the wiki is operational. **Anyone with suggestions feel free to add or comment.**

This project started as a result of the discussion on https://github.com/kororaproject/website/issues/55 and also the request from a number of people to allow contributions by pull requests.

It has been agreed that the wiki won't be used and so it will no longer be updated. The repo will be maintained and it will be used to develop new documents and to accept contributions from the community. The repo will contiue to host the images used on the Korora website documentation.

## Recent Changes
Footer - added, copied from the website
Sidebar - added, however not really required unless it is intended that the wiki be used as the documentation site. Needs manual addition of new pages.

## Suggestions
The lack of sync between the repo and the wiki is going to be a major ongoing issue. Keeping them matching is a difficult job when it needs to be done manually.  

Need to standardise layout. Some docs have a leading H1 which (usually) duplicates the doc title and therefore is superfluous on the wiki. Suggest a H2 is used when it differs from the title and otherwise removed.  
There is also inconsistent use of H2 and H3 within docs. This should be standardised as well.

~~It was suggested that we create a separate repo for documentation, - "if you really want to be able to use PRs for documentation you can use a normal github repo to do the PRs on and the repo owners (those with push permissions) can manually sync to the wiki repo when new documentation is added/accepted"
If this is done it may be better to move this wiki to that repo.
This would also solve the image storage issue as covered in https://github.com/kororaproject/website/issues/56~~ Done

~~It may be necessary to create a Contribution Guidelines doc to simplify acceptance of contributions. One possible issue is image names which could be duplicated. Suggest names reflect the document they attach to.~~ Done.

<a name="sync-to-site"></a>
## Sync to Site
2 documents have been added that cover the most common needs to sync to the website.
First is a totally new document (albeit with formatting that is not supported on the site) - https://github.com/kororaproject/website/wiki/Working-With-Archives
Second is an existing document that has been edited - https://github.com/kororaproject/website/wiki/Which-Desktop-for-Your-Korora

An alternative to syncing back to the website would be to use the wiki and change the link on the website. This change would require the approval of the core team.  
After some trial and error it was found that for images to appear on kp.org they need to use the full path with ?raw=true appended.

### Known Incompatibilities
The Korora website accepts HTML in documentation but it is ignored on GitHub.  
The Korora site doesn't handle tables which work on GitHub. Simple tables may be created using code blocks which use monospace fonts but these may need to be formated manually.
The Korora site doesn't create section links which are needed for TOC so these need to be added manually
